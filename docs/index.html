      <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
          This website was built to protest licensing my dog with petdata.com. You can read more about that <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerChilds/status/1180930646505639947" target="_blank">rant on this twitter thread.</a>
          </p>

          <p>
            The endings of websites, such as .com, .org, .info, can be bought with zero restrictions. For example, this website is a .org. I bought it and had this website built in one hour.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some endings, such as .gov or .edu have restrictions. A .gov must be a government entity and .edu is reserved for education. This is important because these endings indicate authority.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are a list of San Mateo domain names, that I view to lack authority, and thus any one or all of these websites could be potentially not associated with our actual local government.
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li><a href="https://smcgov.org">smcgov.org</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://smchealth.org">smchealth.org</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.cityofsanmateo.org/">cityofsanmateo.org</a></li>
              <li><a href="http://www.sanmateocourt.org/">sanmateocourt.org</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://www.smcacre.org/">smcacre.org</a></li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
          <p>Let's come back full circle to this petdata.com example.</p>

          <p>When I first received a letter in the mail from petdata.com, it referenced a San Mateo County ordinance and fee to license my dog. This linked to a website, smchealth.org, that looks very official. It's probably legit, but I can't verify that by looking at it.</p>

          <p>To me, any mail received that asks for money needs to provide more authority than a simple link to a domain that just about anyone could build.</p>

          <p>This website was thrown together very quickly, but can you imagine if I was trying to steal money from you and wanted to make it look legit, how easy it could be for someone with my particular set of skills?</p>

          <p>The main point I'm getting at is that we need to hold our government to a higher standard. There is literally a way for them to ensure authority to citizens using domain names ending in .gov.</p>
